                    "text": "The safe and economical management of shale gas flowback and produced water (FPW) with the goal of zero-liquid discharge (ZLD) is of paramount significance to the sustainable development of the energy industry. This challenge is still widely impending, due to severe limitations related to the complexity of FPW streams and high costs associated with their treatment. A long-term feasible solution is represented by solar-driven interfacial evaporation (SIE), a low-cost and environmentally friendly desalination technology. Technical and economic analyses show that even in the Sichuan Basin, where solar intensity is low and the volume of FPW is large, 4000 m<sup>2</sup> of solar still would be sufficient to accomplish ZLD with a capital cost lower than $ 1 m<sup>-3</sup>, significantly cheaper than traditional membrane-based and thermal-based technologies (with costs above $ 15 m<sup>-3</sup>). Beneficial products, including condensate water and crystalline salts, may also be effectively recovered in this process, although design improvements are needed in this area. This study also discusses possible solutions to address the passage of volatile organic compounds into the effluent and to achieve the smart recovery of strategic resources, such as lithium and rare earth elements. The major current challenges of solar-driven evaporation for the beneficial management of FPW are scaling and fouling, cost-effective latent heat recovery, the scalability of the systems, and efficient water production and salts harvesting. These issues require ad hoc research efforts, analyses, and pilot testing."

                    "text": "2D solar-driven interfacial evaporation (2D SIE) is a low-cost, environmentally friendly water treatment solution. Studies have improved the performance of single-stage evaporation close to its upper bound in controlled environments. However, the most critical parameter – the rate of evaporation – was only assessed by laboratory-scale measurements and data are typically obtained under a specific set of conditions. Previous studies did not evaluate or modeled evaporation rates in the case of changing environmental variables, for example, temperature, humidity, or wind speed. To effectively utilize the 2D SIE technology at real scale and understand its potential in different scenarios, the spatial and temporal variability of environmental parameters must be considered. To preliminarily address this issue, we propose the first model for assessing the evaporation rate of 2D SIE systems in real environments. Based on this theoretical model, we thus explore the potential deployment of the 2D SIE technology globally. This study provided a basis for further model development and it discusses key information to guide further improvements of 2D SIE systems design and its large-scale implementation."

                    "text": "The volume of shale gas wastewater (SGW) surges notably with shale gas extraction booms in China. Solar driven interfacial evaporation technology (SIE), which presents significant advantages in environmentally-friendly and low-cost treatment of high-salinity wastewater, shows potential in SGW treatment. Herein, SIE technology based on balsa wood was introduced to treat SGW from the Sichuan Basin, and the system efficiency and condensate water safety were comprehensively explored. Under two sun intensity irritation, the evaporation rate of SGW reached 1.50kg/(m<sup>2</sup>·h) with the evaporation efficiency of over 50%. To maintain a relatively consistent evaporation rate, the anti-scalant nitrilotriacetic acid was used and the evaporation rate reduced by only 0.15kg/(m<sup>2</sup>·h) within 8h. Meanwhile, the SIE system showed remarkable total dissolved solids (TDS) removal rate exceeding 99% of SGW. In addition, to ensure the safety of condensate water reuse, the transfer of hazardous organic compounds from raw to condensate water was comprehensively detected. It was found that volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOCs and SVOCs) which were of strong responses in raw SGW exhibited much lower responses or cannot be detected in condensate water, including diisobutyl phthalate, dimethylbenzylamine e and pyridine. The results indicate that SIE is capable of removing the hazardous organic compounds. Compounds of strong response in condensate, such as furfural and 2,6-dimethoxy-phenol, are considered as natural compounds in wood, which are degradable and show low impacts on environment. This study suggested a novel and low-cost approach to SGW treatment."

                    "text": "Large-scale nanofiltration (NF) membrane fabrication relies on the use of harmful solvents and dangerous monomers (e.g., piperazine and trimesoyl chloride). Herein, we employed greener polydopamine (PDA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) co-deposition to construct NF selective layer on poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) substrate prepared using green solvent methyl-5-(dimethylamino)-2-methyl-5-oxopentanoate (PolarClean). The metal-organic framework (MOF) UIO-66 was also co-deposited to tune the NF selective layer property by exploiting hydrogen bonds, Π-Π interaction, and coordination bonds between oxygen functional groups and zirconium (Zr) of UIO-66 and the PDA-PEI complex, as well as its intrinsic properties of high hydrophilicity and positive charge. It also improved the surface area of NF selective layer, contributing to higher permeability. Excessive dosage, higher than 0.1g/L, promoted PDA aggregation, thus reducing its deposition on membrane surfaces and causing defects. When the dosage was 0.05g/L, the ternary coated NF membrane exhibited the best property with low molecular weight cut-off (MWCO, ∼350Da), adequate hydrophilicity, high permeance (3.17±0.3 L m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>), and high MgCl<sub>2</sub> rejection (>80%). When used for shale gas wastewater (SGW) treatment, the ternary coated membrane showed a similar flux level to that observed with commercial ones. Also, it showed removal rates of 58.5% for dissolved organic carbon, 71.1% for fluorescent organics, and 6.2% for total dissolved solids, allowing the effluent to meet the standards of SGW internal reuse. This work helps inspire the next-generation sustainable NF membrane fabrication."
