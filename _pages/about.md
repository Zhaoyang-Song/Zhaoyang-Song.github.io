Hi, my name is Zhaoyang Song. I'm currently a college student at [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), China. Physics is my college major. 

During my undergraduate studies, under the supervision of Prof. Baicang Liu (Sichuan University, China), I participated in research related to carbon neutral technology (on the topic of water treatment). I care about environmental issues and would like to work on related research. I am good at theoretical modeling and I'm also passionate about programming techniques.

In life, my interests are very broad. I especially like hiking, reading novels and playing badminton.
