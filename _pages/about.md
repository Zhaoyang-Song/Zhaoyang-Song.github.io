Hi there, welcome to my personal website.

I'm currently a graduate student at <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en.htm" target="_blank">Wageningen University & Research</a> in the Netherlands, majoring in Environmental Sciences.

My primary research interest lies in the issue of carbon neutrality, with a particular focus on relevant environmental modeling techniques. I am good at theoretical modeling and passionate about programming techniques. My graduate studies focus on atmospheric research, which is a completely new direction for me. Previously, I have been involved in research related to water treatment and carbon neutrality.
