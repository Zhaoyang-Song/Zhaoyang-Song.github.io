My name is Zhaoyang Song, and my undergraduate major is physics. During my undergraduate studies, under the supervision of Prof. Baicang Liu (Sichuan University, China), I participated in research related to carbon neutral technology (on the topic of water treatment). I care about environmental issues and would like to work on related research. I am good at theoretical modeling, and I'm also passionate about programming techniques.

In life, my interests are very broad. I especially like hiking, reading novels and playing badminton.
