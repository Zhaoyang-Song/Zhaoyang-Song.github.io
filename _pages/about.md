Hi, my name is Zhaoyang Song. I'm currently a college student at <a href="https://www.scu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Sichuan University</a>, China. Physics is my college major, and I'm also a student of the Carbon Neutral Technology Innovation Class of Sichuan University.

During my undergraduate studies, under the supervision of Prof. Baicang Liu (Sichuan University, China), I participated in research related to carbon neutral technology (on the topic of water treatment & environmental modeling). I care about environmental issues and would like to work on related research. I am good at theoretical modeling and passionate about programming techniques.

In life, my interests are very broad. I especially like hiking, reading novels and playing badminton.
