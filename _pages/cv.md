# Education

- **M.Sc.** in Environmental Sciences, Wageningen University & Research, Netherlands (02/2024 - present)
- **B.Sc.** in Physics, College of Physics, Sichuan University, P.R. China (09/2019 - 06/2023)
- **Carbon Neutral Technology Innovation Class** (Honours Programme), Institute of New Energy and Low-Carbon Technology, Sichuan University, P.R. China (06/2020 - 06/2023)

# Research Experiences

- **Prof. Mengru Wang's Research Group**, Earth Systems and Global Change Group, Wageningen University & Research, Netherlands (09/2025 - Present)

  > Modeling the yields of four major crops worldwide (maize, soybean, wheat, and rice). Our main focus is on the combined effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer inputs.
  >
  > The project is currently in progress.
  
- **Prof. Wouter Peters's Research Group**, Meteorology and Air Quality Group, Wageningen University & Research, Netherlands (02/2025 - 09/2025)

  > Prof. Wouter Peters and Dr. Auke van der Woude jointly supervised my master’s thesis project. We developed a system to evaluate the performance of atmospheric CO₂ inversion systems under extreme climate scenarios such as droughts.
  
- **Prof. Baicang Liu's Research Group**, College of Architecture and Environment, Institute of New Energy and Low-Carbon Technology, Sichuan University, P.R. China (09/2020 - present)

  > During my undergraduate studies, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=jDVoLL4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Baicang Liu</a> (Sichuan University, China), I participated in research related to carbon neutral technology (on the topic of water treatment & environmental modeling).
  >
  > Our research mainly focuses on solar-driven interfacial evaporation, membrane technology, and hazardous chemical wastewater treatment.
